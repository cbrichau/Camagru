## Description

Camagru is a basic web-based purikura (a Japanese photo booth with fun stickers).

This website allows logged users to take selfies with superposable decorative stickers (like a mustache, a hat or a picture frame) using their webcam. Captured images are likeable and commentable by other users. See [camagru.en.pdf](../master/camagru.en.pdf) for details.
